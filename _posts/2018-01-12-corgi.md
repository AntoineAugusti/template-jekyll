The Welsh Corgi, sometimes known as just a Corgi, got their name from two Welsh words that meant dwarf and dog /ˈkɔːrɡi/, Welsh for "dwarf dog";[5] plural "Corgis" or occasionally the etymologically consistent "Corgwn" (/ˈkɔːrɡuːn/)), is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales, United Kingdom.

Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. In 1925 the first Welsh Corgi was bred.[5] Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.
